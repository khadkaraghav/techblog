    <p>GitHub is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers.
    <p>Microsoft, the biggest single contributor to GitHub, initiated an acquisition of GitHub for $7.5 billion in June, 2018.</p>
        <p>GitHub, which is delivered through a software-as-a-service (SaaS) business model, was started in 2008 and was founded on Git,</p>
        an open source code management system created by Linus Torvalds to make software builds faster.</p>

    <p>GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a web interface to the Git code repository and management tools for collaboration.</p>
    <p>GitHub can be thought of as a serious social networking site for software developers.</p>
    <p>Members can follow each other, rate each other's work, receive updates for specific projects and communicate publicly or privately. </p>
